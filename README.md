## **Mod Execution**

### **Overview**

`mod-execution-as` is a core library in the Veive protocol, dedicated to supporting the creation and integration of execution modules. These modules are responsible for carrying out specific operations within the smart accounts on the Koinos blockchain. The library provides essential tools and interfaces to build robust execution logic, ensuring that operations such as token transfers, smart contract calls, or other blockchain actions are executed correctly.

### **Components and Functional Description**

The `mod-execution-as` library includes key components that facilitate the development and integration of execution modules:

#### **1. `ModExecution` Class**

- **Description**: The `ModExecution` class serves as the foundational class for all execution modules. Developers extend this class to implement the logic necessary for executing specific operations within the Veive protocol.
- **Key Methods**:
  - **`execute`**: This method is central to the execution module's functionality. It is called to perform a specified operation, such as a smart contract call or other blockchain-related actions. Developers override this method to define the exact logic for executing the operation.
  - **`on_install` and `on_uninstall`**: These methods manage the setup and teardown of the execution module. During installation, `on_install` initializes any necessary resources or storage. Conversely, `on_uninstall` handles cleanup tasks, ensuring that the module is properly removed without leaving residual data.
  - **`is_type`**: This method verifies whether the module matches a specific type, using the type ID defined in the module's manifest. It ensures compatibility and proper integration within the smart account framework.

- **Use Case**: When creating a new execution module, developers extend the `ModExecution` class and implement the `execute` method to define how specific operations are carried out. This could include actions like executing smart contract methods, transferring assets, or interacting with other on-chain entities.

#### **2. `modexecution` Proto**

- **Description**: The `modexecution` protocol buffer (proto) defines the data structures necessary for describing and transmitting data related to execution modules.
- **Purpose**: This proto standardizes the format and structure of data passed between the smart account and execution modules, ensuring consistent and reliable communication.
- **Components**:
  - **Data Structures**: Includes types and structures used to describe execution commands, module metadata, and operational parameters.

### **Usage and Integration**

#### **Integration in the Veive Protocol**

The `mod-execution-as` library is integral to the Veive protocol's modular design. It interacts closely with the `account-as` module, allowing smart accounts to utilize execution modules to perform various blockchain operations.

**Flow Integration:**
- The `ModExecution` class and its associated methods are invoked whenever an operation needs to be executed. The execution module takes the operation details and performs the necessary actions, ensuring that the operation adheres to the rules and protocols defined by the account and the blockchain.

**Development and Customization:**
- Developers can customize the `ModExecution` class to create execution modules tailored to specific needs, such as custom asset transfers, complex multi-step transactions, or specialized contract interactions.

### **Scripts**

#### **Build**

To compile the package, run:

```bash
yarn build
```
