## **Mod Execution**

### **Overview**

`mod-execution-as` is a core library in the Veive protocol, dedicated to supporting the creation and integration of execution modules. These modules are responsible for carrying out specific operations within the smart accounts on the Koinos blockchain. The library provides essential tools and interfaces to build robust execution logic, ensuring that operations such as token transfers, smart contract calls, or other blockchain actions are executed correctly.

### **Usage and Integration**

#### **Integration in the Veive Protocol**

The `mod-execution-as` library is integral to the Veive protocol's modular design. It interacts closely with the `account-as` module, allowing smart accounts to utilize execution modules to perform various blockchain operations.

**Flow Integration:**
- The `ModExecution` class and its associated methods are invoked whenever an operation needs to be executed. The execution module takes the operation details and performs the necessary actions, ensuring that the operation adheres to the rules and protocols defined by the account and the blockchain.

**Development and Customization:**
- Developers can customize the `ModExecution` class to create execution modules tailored to specific needs, such as custom asset transfers, complex multi-step transactions, or specialized contract interactions.

### **Scripts**

#### **Build**

To compile the package, run:

```bash
yarn build
```
